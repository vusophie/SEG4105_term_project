#### Focus on one piece
The winning pitch is the shopping cart feature. Much like the backbone of most successful e-commerce platforms, the shopping cart is the unsung hero that significantly influences how our users select and purchase products. it's the bridge that connects the 'browsing' to 'buying' in the most effortless way. <br>
Our platform's existing shopping cart is not user-friendly, which hinders user experience and sales. In order to address this issue, we will design an easy-to-use cart for adding, viewing, and updating items. <br> 
The cart will be accessible from all pages, and also clearly displays the current total price. <br> <br>
